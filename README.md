    % --- Define Connections ---
    User --> UI_User
    Admin --> UI_Admin

    UI_User -- Login/Profile --> UM
    UI_User -- Request Position --> LM
    UI_User -- Request Route --> NM
    UI_Admin -- Manage Users --> UM
    UI_Admin -- Manage Maps/Locations/Routes --> MM

    MM --> MM_Upload % Indicate MM exposes these APIs
    MM --> MM_Location
    MM --> MM_Route

    LM -- Needs Map Data/Locations --> Cache
    NM -- Needs Map/Route Data --> Cache

    LM <--> NM  # Position Update / Context

    Sensors -- Sensor Readings --> LM

    MM_Upload -- Store Map Data --> Cache
    MM_Location -- Store Location Data --> Cache
    MM_Route -- Store Route Data --> Cache

    UM -- Store/Read User Data --> Cache

    Cache -- Read/Write Miss/Persist --> DB # Cache talks to DB for misses/writes
